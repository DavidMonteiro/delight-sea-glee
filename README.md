Welcome,

The Delight Sea Glee project is a website build in a full stack environment build by me, David Monteiro. The prime objective of the website is to provide users the opportunity to ensure a placement at an extravagant restaurant that focus on sea food from my home country Portugal. The website provides this feature by allowing users to make reservations ensuring that in the future they will have seating at this restaurant that will certanly be full of sea food lovers. To ensure the reservations are validated users will be able to sign up to the website to access all the website functionalities. Apart from signing up, signing in and making reservations, users will be able to manage their reservations (alter their reservations date or cancel their reservation) and will be able to leave reviews of their website visit or their overall experience in the website and their experience in the restaurant. The website will have a mainPage, a contactUs and an aboutUs webpage. 

## Issues
Due to time constraints, the website is vastly incomplete missing major aspects of its functionality
